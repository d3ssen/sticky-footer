# sticky-footer

This code is based on code from Ryan Fait, who's code I've used extensively in my designs.
But I found that the original code had been duplicated on other sites with minor changes but somehow didn't work as intended.
So I made this repository to be used as an archive for a working template.

Keep in mind that when you copy this into your code you need to make sure the right content is in between the intended <div>'s.
I hope the <!-- remarks --> are clear about what code to put where.
